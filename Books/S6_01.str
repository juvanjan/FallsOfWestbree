Page_0:"Robert and Floyd,
I have bad news. There's not a lot of time! Just today I met with one of my friends working in the mage's guild. He told me that the mages have planned to arrest you today. They already have town guard under control. If you get caught, there's no hope for this town, so be quick! Run! Run and don't look back!
