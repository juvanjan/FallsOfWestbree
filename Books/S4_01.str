Page_0:"This morning, as i was walking to the butchers to get some meat, I saw the farmer's stable boy being chased by the town guard. He tripped over a stone and dropped his key. He got up and ran away, but he forgot his key. I'm keeping it safe till I meet Floyd since I bet he's woried but I don't see him often lately. I think people have the wrong idea of him. He was always a good hardworking guy, and often brought great knowledge back from far off lands. But something has got into him recently, and I must get down to it. Only then will I know what he really wants to say, and how to say it.
 
I'll keep this page as a reminder to return the key."
