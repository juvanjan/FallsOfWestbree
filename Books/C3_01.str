I have always liked gaining knowledge, and as such I'm proud of all the books I've collected over the years. But in my old age, I just can't search for the book I want quickly. I can barely even read them for long. I wonder what will happen of these books when I'm gone. Do people even bother to read anything besides novels? I think I'll just sell off these books to some bookseller in the City before I die."

And what's happening to the neighbourhood? Sanders Shaw didn't give me the nautical books he promised, which is not at all like him. He may be reserved but he always kept his promises. The slums have been flooding for nearly a week, and just today I saw Nebshale running scared from the sewerman's house! 
At any rate I'm not going to spend the rest of my life in this town, once these floods clear up and I feel a bit better I'm going to be moving to the City to trade off a few bad books I bought and get to talk with some scholars. I desperately need to stir up my mind with some fine talk, and I'm not getting that in Westbree! Not for a month or two now."
