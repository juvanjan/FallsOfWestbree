Page_0:"Lewis,
I greatly worry about you every passing day. We rarely get a chance to talk to each other these days because of the damn night curfew. You are always my dearest partner, in work and in passion.  We will not stay in this filth any longer, my ancestral property has a secret passage to the Old Quarter. They were pretty clever, it's the well in my backyard and I didn't know of it until today! Builder be praised, we have yet a chance! We'll be leaving soon. Meet me tomorrow when the police won't be looking. I'll hide the key in the short alley next to my door.
Love, Ellis"
