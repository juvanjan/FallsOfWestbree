Page_0:"Dewey,
I just came back from my visit to Eastport. It's always been a good place for trade and news but it's never been as lively. There were news from the capital. Times are changing, my friend and not all news are good. I have something very important to talk with you. You will no longer need to stay in this slum if it works out. Meet me at the Rosehuncer's  bar this night. Make sure you're not followed.
Sanders"
