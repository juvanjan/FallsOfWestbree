Sanders invited me to a drink. Oh Lord, how shall I ever get to Rosehuncer's  bar? When night falls, all I ever sense is apparitions everywhere and eyes watching at every step. After the day I visited the mage laboratories for some work, I haven't felt safe at night. Was it their magic, or one of their ingredients?

...ahh, I can't do it! Mercy"
