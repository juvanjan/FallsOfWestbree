The town's been going crazy. First the wolf howls have been rising by the night, and now Dwight has snapped! I know he's had problems lately, but I never knew he would totally lose like that. He's not always been the man we've got to know in the past month.  At first he just murmured some nonsense about eyes watching, but soon he started losing his temper randomly and being rude to everyone. The blacksmith Nebshale still tolerated him because he knew Dwight better than others and was confident he would recover. But today when we went to talk to him he snapped and started trashing the appartment, yelling and foaming if you'd belive it. The blacksmith and I were as shocked as anyone would be."

We fled the scene and Nebshale is now planning to leave the town to get a good mental doctor, and I think I need a break from this town too, but first a few drinks to clear my head.  Nebshale told me he lost his key while trying to escape Dwight's wrath, but damn me if I'm going in there! I know its on the other side of my front door but I'm too affraid to use it.  The only consolation is that Dwight is trapped in the top floor of the blacksmith's apartment and won't hurt anyone for a while. I'll keep the door locked just in case and head to the bar through the window."
