To make things worse, my supplies of stone have been getting delayed for one reason or the other, and a pipe just burst flooding the slums! How am I supposed to sculpt in this knee deep water? I can't work on these huge stone blocks in my home, and the damned bugs in the water make me itch badly! I just hope I don't have to see a doctor for a poisonous bite. Please let the mayor return to this town soon or I'll have to leave this town for good."
