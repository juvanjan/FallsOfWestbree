Page_0:"To The Town Council,
I am very distressed about the recent floods in the slums. I have complained to your workers many times about this, yet they always give excuses and never fix the leaks! They keep saying some make believe about wolves in the sewers or something. How would a wolf ever get into a sewer? These people don't even know how to lie.
Either this gets fixed by the month, or I am leaving the town. And I will demand dues for the damage the flood has done to my business! You can't get away with such shoddy work.
Ms. Gerisyle"
