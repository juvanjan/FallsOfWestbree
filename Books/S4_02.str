Slums got flooded today. What a shame, so many workshops ruined. Worst of all now i have traders gathering nearly in front of my house. Do these people even sleep or just ramble all night long? Funny though, I'm able to overhear everything from upstairs window. Still though, I hope water leak gets fixed and I can have a rest from traders tales."
