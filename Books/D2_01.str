We need to inform you that the books Horticus Naverus, The Plant Notations and Severius Herbicum are long overdue. If you don't return them by the end of this week, we shall charge a fine of 200 gold for each book. We're being lenient on you since you usually return books on time and have been visiting the library for long.
