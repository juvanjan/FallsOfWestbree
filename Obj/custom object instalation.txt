=====================================
Put the .bin files into ThiefII/obj folder.
Put the .gif files into ThiefII/obj/txt16 folder.

 Open Dromed. Go into the object hiearchy and find an existing object that resembles
the item you want to use. Or create a new item under Physical, this way takes more 
editting but you can get closer to what you want.

 Then create and make it in the Dromed like a regular object.
